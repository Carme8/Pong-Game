# Pong Game
Pong Game is one of the first computer games ever created.
This simple “tennis-like” game features two rackets and a ball.
The goal is to defeat the opponent by earning 10 points first.
The game can be played with two human players or with one player against a computer-controlled racket.
The game was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and published in 1972 by Atari corporations.
Soon, Pong became a huge success and became the first commercially successful game;
In 1975, Atari released a home edition of Pong (the first version was played on arcade machines) that sold 150,000 units.
Today, Pong is considered the game that started the video game industry.
